Question

A question has a surface structure (the raw text) and a relational representation.

Interpretation

The question is interpreted into an interpretation. An interpretation is a language independent, idiom free, explicit, relational representation of the question.
It contains no database-specific relations, and no language-specific relations. It is explicit enough to contain all elements needed to answer the question.

Database relational representation

A relational representation that contains relations as they are used in a specific database.

Query

A database specific representation as required to access the database.

Database result

The database result as a set of records that contain bindings for each of the free variables in the Interpretation.

Formulation

A relational representation that combines the Interpretation with the database results.

Generation

A surface representation of the answer.
